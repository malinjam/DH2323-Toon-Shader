            Hello! <br />
            We, Ferran Campos Llopart (<a href="mailto:ferrancl@kth.se">ferrancl@kth.se</a>), Malin Malin Jauad Almeida Marques 
            (<a href="mailto:malinjam@kth.se">malinjam@kth.se</a>), and Maria Zelenika (<a href="mailto:zelenika@kth.se">zelenika@kth.se</a>),
            are first-year master students studying Interactive Media Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. <br />

            We have created this blog as part of our project for the course Computer Graphics with Interaction (DH2323). Our project focuses on developing
            a toon-shader and conducting a perceptual study to analyze how different shapes influence the perception of glossiness. Through this blog, we
            aim to share insights about our project, including the techniques employed, our experiences, both the mistakes and successes, in reverse chronological order. <br />

            To access the code, Unity project, and this blog, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/malinjam/DH2323-Toon-Shader">Github repository</a>. <br />

            The implementation phase involved assigning the specific values to the chosen materials as follows:
            <div class="image_container">
                <img src="img/6.png" alt="Parameters used for the materials">
            </div>
            Subsequently, we captured screenshots of the rendered materials and incorporated them into a survey created 
            using Google Forms. The survey starts with a concise introduction, followed by a request for participants' consent. 
            We provide an explanation of glossiness, along with illustrative examples (image below) of image pairs featuring diverse objects and 
            varying degrees of glossiness.
            <div class="image_container">
                <img src="img/7.png" alt="Survey examples">
            </div>
            Participants are subsequently presented with a sequence of 63 image pairs, with which varied in shape, material and glossiness, 
            and asked to indicate which object appears to be more glossy. <br />

                <img src="img/8.png" alt="Survey stimuli">
            </div>
            Once the survey was finalized, we proceeded to share it and aim to collect a minimum of 30 responses to ensure scientific 
            relevance and statistical significance. <br />

            While awaiting the responses, we have been actively working on writing and refining the project report and specification. 
            This stage involves consolidating and documenting the study's methodology, findings, and conclusions to present a comprehensive 
            research outcome.

        <p>
            We found a <a href="https://www.merl.com/brdf/">database</a> with a 100 different materials implemented.
            <div class="image_container">
                <img src="img/1.jfif" alt="Ward BRDF model formula">

            <div class="image_container">
                <img src="img/2.jfif" alt="Ward BRDF model formula">
            </div>
            It is using the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which is a general reflection model that can be used to represent a
            wide range of materials and surfaces, including both smooth and rough surfaces. It provides a flexible and versatile representation that can capture various
            reflection behaviors. <br />
            Unfortunately, that is not the goal of this study, since we want to used the Ward BRDF model, which is particularly suited for representing
            glossy or specular surfaces with microfacet structures. It is often used to simulate materials like metals or plastics, where the microfacet orientation and
            roughness play a significant role in the reflection properties. <br />
            So we tried to implement this formula mentioned in this <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/npr_materials.pdf">Bousseau et al.'s paper</a>: <br />
            <div class="image_container">
                <img src="img/2.png" alt="Ward BRDF model formula">
            </div>
            We then modified our materials to use our now Toon-Ward-shader: <br />
            PHOTOS <br />
            We merged the different branches in Github so as to have the 3D objects and materials in the same place: <br />
            <div class="image_container">
                <img src="img/1.png" alt="3D objects and materials merged into one scene">
            </div>            
            After consulting with our professor, we received valuable guidance and feedback that aided us in refining our approach and structuring our perceptual study. Additionally, we came across 
            <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/133994.134078">Ward's paper</a>, which provides specific parameter values for the isotropic formula mentioned earlier. These 
            parameter values are depicted in the image below:
            <div class="image_container">
                <img src="img/5.png" alt="Parameters for isotropic materials calculated by Ward">
            </div>
            To ensure a comprehensive investigation, we decided to select three different materials representing low (painted cardboard bow), normal (lightly brushed aluminum), and high (rolled brass) 
            glossiness levels. Additionally, we will calculate two variations of the same material, each exhibiting low and high glossiness, respectively. By including these variations, we aim to determine 
            if participants can effectively distinguish between different levels of glossiness in the perceptual study. The materials will use the same color scheme so as not to give hints to the specific 
            material based on color and to focus solely on glossiness.

            The chosen materials and their glossiness levels will be critical in examining potential differences in perception and discernment among participants.

            We noticed that in the videogame the creators seem to avoid having windows directly visible, which makes sense since when you use a toon-shader it is hard to 
            make them since it often simplifies or stylizes reflections, so they might have opted for a more straightforward approach rather than attempting to create physically 
            accurate reflections. And we experienced sometimes being unable to see the various parts of our shader, such as the difference in glossiness, since when you use a lighter 
            color for the object, you need a higher glossiness, that is contrast, in order to see it, while the opposite is true for darker objects. This was confirmed by 
            <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/4299/0000/Psychophysically-based-model-of-surface-gloss-perception/10.1117/12.429501.short?SSO=1">Pellacini et al.'s paper</a>.

            We were unable to find papers on toon-shading perception, asked the professor for help through emails, defined our idea more firmly, and got this great 
            <a href="https://graphics.cs.kuleuven.be/publications/VangorpPhD/">Vangorp's paper</a>.
            This study, however, does not use a toon-shader and renders different materials using information from a database (not publicly available). We are unable 
            to find a similar database that provides material information for toon shaders. We think we can solve this by rendering different materials and recreating 
            them by looking at objects from a videogame that uses toon-shading. Many popular franchises, such as "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" (first image below),
             and "Borderlands" (second image below) have adopted toon-shading to great effect, so we are planning to use one of them.

            We implemented a toon-shader by following this <a href="https://roystan.net/articles/toon-shader/">tutorial</a>. The code is written with Unity's ShaderLab 
            language. It defines a shader called "Custom/NewSurfaceShader" that creates a specific visual effect on a surface to make the sphere you see below toon-like.

            In this project, we decided that our focus is going to be on toon-shading (or cel-shading), a non-photorealistic rendering technique that gives a mesh a cartoonish appearance and a 
            hand-drawn feel in the final render. This technique has been used in the animation industry for years and has been applied in video games. Conventional Toon Shading  
            utilises the orientation of a 1D texture in relation to a light source to determine the color of a given area. This is done by extending the Lambertian shading model 
            and thereby deciding the colour of an area. This style of shading renders every surface location with full accuracy, thereby allowing even small shape features to be 
            rendered by the shader. <br />
