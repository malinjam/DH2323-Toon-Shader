            Hello! <br />
            We, Ferran Campos Llopart (<a href="mailto:ferrancl@kth.se">ferrancl@kth.se</a>), Malin Malin Jauad Almeida Marques 
            (<a href="mailto:malinjam@kth.se">malinjam@kth.se</a>), and Maria Zelenika (<a href="mailto:zelenika@kth.se">zelenika@kth.se</a>),
            are first-year master students studying Interactive Media Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. <br />

            We have created this blog as part of our project for the course Computer Graphics with Interaction (DH2323). Our project focuses on developing
            a toon-shader and conducting a perceptual study to analyze how different shapes influence the perception of glossiness. Through this blog, we
            aim to share insights about our project, including the techniques employed, our experiences, both the mistakes and successes, in reverse chronological order. <br />

            To access the code, Unity project, and this blog, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/malinjam/DH2323-Toon-Shader">Github repository</a>. <br />
            You can download our <a href="img/DH2323_Project_specification.pdf" download="DH2323-Toon-shader">report</a> and

            We found a <a href="https://www.merl.com/brdf/">database</a> with a 100 different materials implemented. <br />
            <div class="image_container">

            </div> <br />
            It is using the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which is a general reflection model that can be used to represent a
            wide range of materials and surfaces, including both smooth and rough surfaces. It provides a flexible and versatile representation that can capture various
            reflection behaviors. <br />
            Unfortunately, that is not the goal of this study, since we want to used the Ward BRDF model, which is particularly suited for representing
            glossy or specular surfaces with microfacet structures. It is often used to simulate materials like metals or plastics, where the microfacet orientation and
            roughness play a significant role in the reflection properties. <br />
            So we tried to implement this formula mentioned in this <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/npr_materials.pdf">Bousseau et al.'s paper</a>: <br />
            <div class="image_container">

            </div> <br />
            We then modified our materials to use our now Toon-Ward-shader: <br />

            We merged the different branches in Github so as to have the 3D objects and materials in the same place: <br />

            We implemented various materials (glass, iron, gold metal, clay, metallic blue, metallic silver, stone, leather, red paint, opal) taking inspiration
            from the videogame Zelda: Breath of the Wild. <br />
            We noticed that... <br />

            We were unable to find papers on toon-shading perception, ask professor for help through emails, defined our idea more firmly and got this great
            <a href="https://graphics.cs.kuleuven.be/publications/VangorpPhD/">paper</a>.
            This study does however not use a toon shader and renders different materials using information from a database (not publicly available). We are 
            unable to find a similar database that provides material information for toon shaders. We think we can solve this by rendering different materials 
            by recreating them by looking at objects from a videogame that uses toon shading.

            We found a <a href="https://free3d.com/">website</a> where we were able to get free 3D objects with which we could conduct our perceptual study. We
            also used 3D objects (sphere, cilinder, capsule) already available in Unity. <br />
